	<p>How to make <strong>Millionaire's Shortbread</strong>! Rich caramel bars made with three layers of crispy and
		buttery shortbread, thick caramel, and chocolate ganache sprinkled with sea salt flakes. Made with basic pantry
		ingredients they're super easy to make and impossible to resist.</p>
	<p> Chocolate, caramel, and shortbread, it’s a pretty incredible combination that totally lives up to its name, I
		mean, I don’t know anyone who can resist a square of Millionaire’s shortbread. I love to use semi-sweet chocolate
		for a slightly bitter and richer flavor and top them with sea salt flakes which makes them extra delicious, hello
		salted caramel!</p>
	<p>There are no fancy ingredients involved so they’re super easy to make and will keep well for a few days or can be
		frozen making them a great prep-ahead treat. For more chocolate and caramel treats check out my

	<h2>What you need to make this recipe</h2>
	<img src="images/Millionaires-shortbread-ingredients-preppy-kitchen.jpg" />
	<p><strong>Butter</strong> – I use unsalted butter because additional salt is added, make sure your butter is at room
		temperature.</p>
	<p><strong>Condensed milk</strong> – sweetened condensed milk is a key ingredient for making a super sweet, thick,
		and delicious
		caramel!</p>
	<p><strong>Sugar</strong> – I use a mix of both granulated white sugar and brown sugar which gives a delicious
		caramel/molasses
		flavor.</p>
	<p><strong>Chocolate</strong> – Millionaire’s shortbread is really rich so I like to use a less sweet
		tasting chocolate like
		semi-sweet or bitter-sweet. You can use good-quality chocolate chips for ease or chop up a good quality chocolate
		bar.</p>

	<p>5. Pour the caramel over the shortbread layer and chill.</p>
	<p>6. Make the chocolate ganache by adding the chocolate and cream to a bowl over a double boiler or microwave and
		melt. Spread over the chilled caramel and shortbread base and sprinkle with sea salt. Chill in the fridge until
		your millionaire’s shortbread is set.</p>

		<h2 class="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3 class="faq-question">Why didn’t my caramel set?</h3>
		<p class="faq-answer">
		<p>Your caramel needs to reach a minimum of 224F to set so if you undercook it you’ll run into issues. A sugar
			thermometer makes things super easy here but if you don’t have one make sure the caramel starts to pull away
			from
			the edges of the pan and is really thick before removing it from the heat.</p>
		<h3>Are there variations?</h3>
		<p>The best way to change up millionaire’s shortbread is to experiment with different chocolate on top. Why not
			try
			swirling in some white melted chocolate which will create a fun pattern too! Check out my Scotcheroos, Pecan
			Pie
			Bars, or Peanut Butter Bars for something a little different.</p>
		<h3>How long do they last?</h3>
		<p>Store the squares in an airtight container there’s no need to refrigerate. They’ll keep well for up to 5 days.
		</p>
		<h3>Can I freeze them?</h3>
		<p>Yes, millionaire’s shortbread freeze really well but make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or foil and
			freeze them individually. Thaw them completely before serving.</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p class="left-align">1. Preheat oven to 350F and line a 9x9 inch baking dish with parchment paper or foil.</p>
	<p class="left-align">2. Cream the butter then add the sugar, salt and beat until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla
		and egg yolk then
		mix until combined. Add the flour in a few batches and mix until just combined.</p>
	<p class="left-align">3. Transfer to your prepared pan and press into an even layer then bake at 350F for about 22
		minutes or until the
		edges are golden.</p>
	<p class="left-align">4. While the base bakes make the caramel. This is easiest with a candy thermometer but you
		don't need one.
		Combine the butter, brown sugar, salt, vanilla, sweetened condensed milk and either golden syrup or corn syrup.
	</p>
	<p class="left-align">5. Place over medium heat and whisk until melted and combined then continue whisking over the
		heat while the
		caramel bubbles and dakens to a richer color. Once it reaches 225F you'll see it starts to thicken and pull
		away from the edge, 5-6 minutes, your caramel is ready.</p>
	<p class="left-align">6. Pour onto the shortbread base, smooth to the edges creating a flat layer. Chill for about 10
		minutes so the
		caramel sets.</p>
	<p class="left-align">7. Chop chocolate and melt with cream either in a double boiler or be microwaving in 2-3 20
		second bursts,
		stirring in between. Pour the chocolate over the caramel and smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle with salt if
		desired then chill and cut into pieces.</p>
